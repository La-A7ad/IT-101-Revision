### Detailed Breakdown of Lecture 6

#### Introduction
- **Scenario**:
  - The lecture starts with a relatable scenario where multiple versions of a document (e.g., EssayFinal, EssayFinal2, EssayFinalRevised) are created during editing.
  - It emphasizes the challenges of keeping track of changes and maintaining different versions manually.

#### Version Control System (VCS)
- **Challenges Addressed by VCS**:
  1. **Collaboration**: Allows multiple people to work on the same project from different locations.
  2. **Version Management**: Stores multiple versions of files, making it easier to manage commits.
  3. **Data Backup**: Protects against data loss if a system or disk fails.
  4. **Restoring Previous Versions**: Facilitates reverting to earlier versions to find bugs or undo changes.
  5. **Change Tracking**: Helps understand what changes were made and by whom.

- **Definition**:
  - VCS, also known as source control or revision control, tracks the progress of code through its lifecycle and multiple iterations.
  - Maintains a record of every change, including authorship, timestamp, and details.

#### Types of Version Control Systems
1. **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)**:
   - Stores files in a central repository.
   - All users work with the same repository.
   - Major drawback: single point of failure.

2. **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**:
   - Clients fully mirror the repository.
   - Allows offline operations (commit, branch, log view).
   - Network connection is needed only for publishing changes and syncing.

3. **Lock-Based VCS**:
   - Uses file locking to prevent conflicting changes.
   - Only one user can edit a file at a time.

4. **Optimistic VCS**:
   - Users work in private workspaces.
   - Changes are merged by the server to avoid conflicts.

#### Benefits of Version Control
1. **Streamline Merging and Branching**:
   - Allows simultaneous work and merging of different streams of work.

2. **Examine and Experiment with Code**:
   - Enables creating clones for new features or testing without affecting the main project.

3. **Track Changes**:
   - Records modifications for future reference and troubleshooting.

4. **Access Modification History**:
   - Maintains a detailed history of all changes, including authorship and timestamps.

5. **Automated Backups**:
   - Regular backups to protect against data loss.

6. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - Facilitates compliance by tracking all changes and maintaining records.

#### Famous Version Control Systems
- Examples include Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial, and CVS.

#### Git and GitHub
- **Git**:
  - An open-source VCS created in 2005 for Linux development.
  - Tracks file changes and allows reverting to previous states.

- **GitHub**:
  - A company providing tools that integrate with Git.
  - Not necessary for Git use but enhances collaboration and code sharing.
  - Alternatives: GitLab, BitBucket, self-hosted solutions like Gogs and Gitea.

#### How Git Works
- **Local Repository**:
  - Stores files and their development history.
  - Commits are snapshots of changes, identified by unique hashes.

- **Repository Content**:
  - Includes source files, build scripts, documentation, and resource files.
  - Excludes generated files (e.g., `.o`, `.dll`, `.class`, `.exe`).

#### Branching
- **Concept**:
  - Branches are parallel copies of the source code.
  - Developers work on features independently and merge changes into the main version (master branch) after completion.

#### Commit
- **File States in Git**:
  - **Modified**: Changes made but not yet staged.
  - **Staged**: Changes marked for inclusion in the next commit.
  - **Committed**: Changes stored in the Git database.

- **Workflow**:
  - Make changes in files.
  - Stage changes using `git add`.
  - Commit changes with `git commit -m "message"`.

#### Installing Git and Configuring the Environment
- **Installation Command**:
  - `sudo apt-get install git`

- **Verify Installation**:
  - `git --version`

- **Configuration Commands**:
  - `git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"`
  - `git config --global user.email you@somewhere.com`

#### Creating a Project
- **Commands**:
  - `mkdir tmp`
  - `cd tmp`
  - `mkdir test1`
  - `cd test1`
  - `git init` to initialize the repository.

#### Stage and Commit Example
- **Staging**:
  - `git add <filename>` to stage files.
  - `git add -A` to stage all existing files.

- **Committing**:
  - `git commit -m "message"` to commit changes.

### Additional Content from Images
The images from the lecture include:
1. **Examples of Git Commands**:
   - Step-by-step examples of staging and committing files.
2. **Visual Representation of Git Workflow**:
   - Diagrams showing the process of making changes, staging, and committing.
3. **Examples of Repository Content**:
   - Examples of files that should and should not be included in the repository.
